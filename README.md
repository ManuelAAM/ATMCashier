# ATMCashier
Functional ATM software in Java
CashierAPP is the main file in this Java project, where it runs and utilices "CajeroGUI" that holds the encapsulation of the Graphical User Interface using JOptionPanes, and "Cuenta" represents the variables and logic for the transactions in the bank account.

This project was created utilizing Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles I managed to integrate a Menu, Account classes and a simple GUI. The modular design used enhances code reusability and maintainability, supporting future feature expansions and saving time.
Enabled banking operations such as deposits, withdrawals, and balance inquiries. The GUI design adheres to Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture, separating logic from the user interface to ensure a clean, efficient user experience.
It's also implemented with robust OOP encapsulation techniques to protect data.
